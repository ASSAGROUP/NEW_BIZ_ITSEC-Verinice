0,0 Welcome,,"The ISA provides the basis for - a self assessment to determine the state of information security within the organization (e.g. company) - audits performed by internal departments (e.g. Internal Audit, Information Security) - a review in accordance with TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange, http://enx.com/tisax/)",,,,,,5.0.2
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"The ISA consists of several tabs, the content and function of which are explained below. You will find actual requirements in the tabs Information Security, Data Protection and Prototype Protection. With Version 5, the ISA structures requirements no longerin lines, but in columns. Additionally, it has introduced new numbering and combined topics. It retains the numbering of ISA 4 for easier finding of control questions according to the previous structure or to facilitate rearrangement.",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Maturity levels:</b>",,,,,,
,,,"ISA provides assessment of the implementation by means of a six-level maturity model as defined in this tab. The maturity levels comprise Incomplete, Performed, Managed, Established, Predictable and Optimizing. With this ISA version, the target maturity level for all control questions is 3 (Established).",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Definitions: </b>",,,,,,
,,,"Under Definitions, the key terms of the requirements to be fulfilled are described. The associated requirements can be assigned to the categories MUST and SHOULD, Additionally in case of HIGH protection needs and Additionally in case of VERY HIGH protection needs. This subdivision is necessary as information of high and very high protection needs requires special protective measures. Additionally, key terms and abbreviations are listed and explained in this tab.",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Cover: </b>",,,,,,
,,,"The cover contains boxes for information on the implementing organization, the scope of the assessment, the auditor and the contact person of the assessed organization.",,,,,,

,,,"<b>Information Security:</b>",,,,,,
,,,"The tab “Information Security includes all basic controls based on the standard ISO/IEC 27001. The controls themselves are formulated as questions. The objective of the respective control and the requirements for achieving it are listed in accordingly designated columns. You must assess each control according to the degree to which the objective is achieved. You can record the assessed maturity levels (as described in the tab “Maturity levels) of each control in column E. The maturity levels will be automatically transferred to the tab “Results. Additional columns give examples to support potential implementation.",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Prototype Protection:</b>",,,,,,
,,,"Prototype protection includes vehicles, components and parts which are classified as requiring protection but have not yet been presented to the public and/or published in adequate form by the OEM. The commissioning OEM department is responsible for classifying the protection needs of vehicles, components and parts. The minimum requirements for prototype protection are to be applied for protection classes High and Very high according to ISA. ",,,,,,

,,,"<b>Further information</b>",,,,,,
,,,"For the purposes of  ISA, the term supplier includes classic suppliers and contractors as well as classic service providers, freelancers or other partner organizations. The control also includes cooperation partners (e.g. academic institutions).

The explanations below describe a possible procedure for fulfilling the requirements:

Identification of suppliers and specification of protection needs and security requirements: At first, all suppliers should be identified (e.g. via the list of creditors of the accountants department) in order to gain an initial overview.
For all contractors, the respective protection needs should be specified and the security requirements derived according to their tasks and the relevance to own and customer’s processes.
Generally, a large number of suppliers will be found to not require the assignment of relevant protection needs and to be therefore not subject to security requirements (e.g. suppliers of office supplies).

Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
In the next step, the applicable requirements should be made known to all security-relevant suppliers in a suitable manner and (contractually) agreed on as being mandatory. Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that suppliers implement the necessary requirements.

Establishment in standard processes:
Based on the gathered findings, a reasonable procedure should be developed and incorporated into the existing processes of the B2B/supplier management. This starts with the selection of the supplier, where aspects of information security should already be taken into account alongside criteria such as quality, adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement process should be such that the relevance of information security has already been taken into account beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision; contract design; inspection requirements).
Furthermore, it is recommended to incorporate information security aspects into existing processes for supplier evaluation which have already been established by e.g. an existing quality management system. Contractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability requirements) should be verified at regular intervals. This can be done by e.g. regular analysis of service reports and SLAs.  ",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Support:Examples “Normal protection need</b>",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Identification of suppliers and specification of protection needs and security requirements:</b>
Critical questions of this evaluation are whether suppliers, while fulfilling their tasks
1) are granted access to or insight of information or security zones of the company rated with normal protection needs regarding confidentiality, or
2) provide or can  relevant information with normal protection needs regarding integrity, or
3) can have relevant impact on processes or IT systems with normal protection needs regarding availability (cf. internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical suppliers with normal protection needs are e.g. cleaning services for general areas, classic logistics companies or maintenance staff.

The minimum requirements for information security (in relation to the respective protection objective) should be defined in a policy (e.g. information security policy for service providers). These requirements can be based on the requirements of the ISA described herein in addition to the company-specific requirements. This policy can be supplemented according to the specific order.

<b>Ensuring implementation by the contractor:</b>
The security requirements should be made known to the contractor, e.g. at procurement, in briefings (project meetings) by corresponding documents (e.g. information security policy for service providers) or when entering the premises (in case of contractors providing their services on site). Compliance with the information security requirements should be contractually fixed. At this point already, potential further subcontractors of the contractor should also be considered, as relevant. This can be done by individual agreements such as general terms and conditions of purchase, for example.  In many cases, suppliers (e.g. IT service providers) already assure compliance with security requirements in their standard contracts.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
- as a minimum, submission of a management-confirmed self-disclosure (e.g. ISA) or a suitable attestation/certificate
- right to and execution of irregular sampling and event-related inspections.",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Support:Examples “High protection need</b>",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Identification of suppliers and specification of protection needs and security requirements:</b>
Critical questions of this evaluation are whether suppliers, while fulfilling their tasks
1) are granted access to or insight of information or security zones of the company rated with high protection needs regarding confidentiality, or
2) provide or can alter relevant information with high protection needs regarding integrity, or
3) can have relevant impact on processes or IT systems with high protection needs regarding availability (cf. internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical suppliers with high protection needs are e.g. cleaning services autonomously cleaning relevant security zones, IT service providers (e.g. data base administrators), consultants, agencies and contractors (e.g. tool designers to whom project data need to be forwarded).

Obviously, suppliers with high protection needs are subject to the minimum information security requirements regarding the respective protection objective. These requirements should be individually supplemented with necessary general requirements (e.g. see ISA, high protection needs) and order-specific requirements.

<b>Ensuring implementation by the supplier:</b>
The procedure described for normal protection needs can be used as a starting point. Besides the obligation regarding implementation of an adequate information security level and the non-disclosure obligation, a right to audit or appropriate controls (regular auditing of the contractor) should be should be contractually agreed on. This may also include an obligation to participate in TISAX.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
- supplier requires TISAX label for high protection needs or equivalent (e.g. ISO 27001, certificate of corresponding scope) - right to and execution of regular sampling and event-related inspections. ",,,,,,
,,,"",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Support:Examples “Very high protection need</b>",,,,,,
,,,"<b>Identification of controls and specification of protection needs and security requirements:</b>
Critical questions of this evaluation are whether suppliers, while fulfilling their tasks
1) are granted access to or insight of information or security zones of the company rated with very high protection needs regarding confidentiality, or
2) provide or can alter relevant information with very high protection needs regarding integrity, or
3) can have relevant impact on processes or IT systems with very high protection needs regarding availability (cf. internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical suppliers with very high protection needs are IT service providers (e.g. domain administrators), consultants, agencies, subcontractors (e.g. CAD designers to whom extensive project data of very high protection needs need to be forwarded) and prototype manufacturers.

Obviously, suppliers with very high protection needs are subject to the minimum information security requirements regarding the respective protection needs. These requirements should be individually supplemented with necessary general requirements (e.g. see ISA, very high protection needs) and order-specific requirements. The difference to high protection needs is essentially the number and quality of the necessary additional requirements.

<b>Ensuring implementation by the contractor:</b>
Here, the procedure described for high protection needs can be used as a starting point. Besides the obligation regarding implementation of an adequate information security level and the non-disclosure obligation, a right to audit and/or appropriate controls (regular auditing of the contractor) should be contractually agreed on . This should also include an obligation to participate in TISAX.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
